# Discussion Questions: Lists, Dictionaries and Classes

## Instructions

Find the questions in 3 files in the `/lib` directory. Choose one member of the group/pair to display the code on their screen.  Your goal is to code out and/or write down the answer to each question asked. Take turns answering each question and try to talk through your thought process while solving the problem. Finally, when your group is finished, signal the instructor and we'll gather back together to share our answers. *Happy coding!*
